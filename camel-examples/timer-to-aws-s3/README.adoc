= Timer to AWS S3 example

== How to run it 

In order to connect to the S3 bucket you will need to provide connection information. To avoid persisting that information, in this example, I'm using environment variables.

----
export S3_BUCKET_NAME=
export S3_ACCESS_KEY=
export S3_SECRET_KEY=
export S3_REGION=
